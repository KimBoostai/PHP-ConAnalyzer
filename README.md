in5t4-h4ck v1.3
===============

Gets a visitors nationality, hostname, IP and user-agent info (UA).

This script-version still works, but due to MaxMind changing their database-format (2014)
it should be considered abandonware.

I am currently working on v1.4, which will support MaxMind's new db-format.

Requirements
============
PHP 5.x + Apache httpd 2.x + libapache2-mod-geoip.

GeoIP Apache module (c) MaxMind - http://www.maxmind.com/app/mod_geoip
