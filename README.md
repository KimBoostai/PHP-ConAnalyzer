ConAnalyzer v1.3.1
==================

Gets a visitors nationality, hostname, IP and user-agent info (UA).

This script-version still works, but due to MaxMind changing their database-format (2014)
it should be considered abandonware. The legacy database currently used is going to be
deprecated in 2022.

Requirements
============
PHP 5.x + Apache httpd 2.x + libapache2-mod-geoip.

GeoIP Apache module (c) MaxMind - http://www.maxmind.com/app/mod_geoip
